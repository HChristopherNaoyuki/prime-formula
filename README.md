# Formula Calculator

## Overview

This Java program calculates the value of \( p_n \) based on a specific mathematical formula involving nested summations and trigonometric functions. It serves as an example of numerical methods and can be a helpful resource for those studying mathematics and programming.

## Features

- Computes \( p_n \) for a given integer \( n \).
- Utilizes nested loops to perform summations.
- Incorporates trigonometric calculations (cosine and cotangent inverse).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HChristopherNaoyuki/prime-formula.git
   cd formula-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac FormulaCalculator.java
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   java FormulaCalculator
   ```

   You can modify the `n` variable in the `main` method to calculate different values of \( p_n \).

## Example

For an example value of \( n = 12 \), the program will output the calculated value of \( p_{12} \).

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
